This project is an ATM Management User Interface (UI) that allows users to perform various banking transactions, including checking balances, depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring funds, and viewing transaction history. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create a web-based ATM application.

**Usage**
- When the application is launched, it will display a user interface for interacting with the ATM.
